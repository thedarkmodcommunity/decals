# Contributing
Contributions to this repository are accepted by pull request only.  If you are new to Git or Github, you can start [here](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/quickstart)

## Conventions
All contributions should use the following conventions:
- the repository file structure follows that of The Dark Mod.  This is hopefully familiar to mappers and should help when choosing a location to put your assets.  Please follow the same convention.
- place your files in a new folder in the appropriate location.  This allows a separate README.md file to be automatically displayed for your contribution
- provide a JPEG preview of your model by including a 1280x720 image in the root of your folder
- provide a README.md with a brief description of your contribution, any installation instructions and a link to the preview file.  Please use the [template](README.template.md) provided for the README.

See any of the existing asset folders for examples of how this should look.
